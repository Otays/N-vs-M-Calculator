# N-vs-M-Calculator
This calculator determines the chance of success for an overlay minigame my friend created for his twitch stream.

I viewed this program as an exercise to refresh myself on probability theory and C code, but its main purpose was just to amuse a friend of mine.  I'm not exactly sure how accurate it is, but it surely applies to many scenarios outside of the one intended for.  Any and all feedback is welcome.

Note: When N>10 or M>10 the calculations lose accuracy.
